Bot which reports the status of London TFL services.

Available in Telegram: [link](https://t.me/LondiBot)

## What is Londibot?

Londibot started as a wrapper around the TFL API so I could get aquainted with Clojure when I first arrived to London
(Autumn 2018). As I spent more time in the city, I realized that the public transport services were slightly
underwhelming â€“ it's not unusual for any underground line to suffer delays a couple of times a day. That's when I
decided that the TFL API wrapper could actually be so much more and help me with that struggle.

Currently, **Londibot is a Telegram/Slack bot which allows users to subscribe to any underground/overground line so it
notifies them upon any service change**, be it a disruption or a recovery. It supports a wide variety of commands, all
the way from `/status` to `/subscribe Victoria, Metropolitan`. More on this below.

## And technically, how is it structured?

Currently Londibot runs as a Phoenix application. It's divided between all the core logic under the `londibot` directory
and all the web stuffs under `londibot_web`. Furthermore, the core business logic under `londibot` is presented under
the following structure:

- **TFL**, takes care of connecting via HTTP with the TFL API and adding the logic of which statuses are good, bad, etc.
- **Subscriptions**, is in charge of handling user subscriptions to lines. It saves and queries them.
- **Notifications** is one of the bigger blocks. It contains the different wrappers for the Slack/Telegram
  messaging APIs as well as a worker which polls TFL and discerns when to send a message or not.
- **Commands** contains the logic to be executed for each command sent to the bot.

## Using Londibot

Currently Londibot supports multiple commands, slightly different across services to improve UX.

### Telegram

In case you're using the Telegram bot, different slash commands have been provided to make the bot more discoverable.

- `/status` will respond with a brief summary of all lines' status, like the dashboard you can find in the subway.
- `/disruptions` will respond just with the current disruptions in all the transport network
- `/subscriptions` will respond with a list of lines to which you are subscribed
- `/subscribe circle, london overground` will subscribe to the given lines
- `/unsubscribe victoria, northern` will unsubscribe to the given lines

### Slack

To use Londibot via Slack, a slash command has been set up: `/londibot`. I have opted for having a single slash
command since often Slack installations will have many bots and having too many slash commands ends up in being
more confusing.

- `/londibot status` will respond with a brief summary of all lines' status, like the dashboard you can find in
  the subway.
- `/londibot disruptions` will respond just with the current disruptions in all the transport network
- `/londibot subscriptions` will respond with a list of lines to which you are subscribed
- `/londibot subscribe circle, london overground` will subscribe to the given lines
- `/londibot unsubscribe victoria, northern` will unsubscribe to the given lines

## Getting started

To start the server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start the server with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser or
run some sample requests like in [sample_requests.http](./sample_requests.http).

To run the tests, run: `mix test`.

### Setting up the DB

To save user subscriptions, I've decided to go with Postgres (PG). Before continuing, make sure you have a running
instance in your computer. In case you're running MacOS, I find it very convenient to use homebrew services to start
and stop the DB:

Starting PG: `brew services start postgresql`
Stoping PG: `brew services stop postgresql`

Once you have the PG up and running, to create the DB run: `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate` (make sure to have
a user `postgres` without password and superuser role).
